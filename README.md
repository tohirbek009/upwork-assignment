## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to two key projects, each with its unique focus and objectives:

## Part 1: Vue 2 To-Do List Application
In the first part of this assignment, we will create a Vue 2 To-Do List Application. This application aims to demonstrate proficiency in Vue 2, emphasizing essential Vue concepts such as directives (v-for, v-bind, v-on), state management, and responsive design. The application allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks while ensuring that it functions seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Additionally, basic styling using CSS or a CSS framework will be applied to enhance the user experience.

## Part 2: Migration to Vue 3 with Nuxt.js
The second part of this assignment involves migrating the Vue 2 To-Do List Application to Vue 3 with Nuxt.js. This migration reflects industry trends and best practices, focusing on the Vue 3 Composition API, reactivity system, and the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) and optimized routing provided by Nuxt.js. The migration will encompass not only the codebase but also the integration of unit tests using Vitest to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the application.

Follow the instructions in this README to set up, develop, and test both projects. Your successful completion of these assignments will showcase your proficiency in Vue.js and your ability to adapt to modern Vue 3 and Nuxt.js practices.
